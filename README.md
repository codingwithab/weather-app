# Weather App

## How does it work?

The weather app is an application which allows the user to input a location and once the user clicks enter, the app will display the temperature, location, humidity, what the temperature feels like, minimum temperature and maximum temperature.

The application uses the OpenWeather API, the data that is fetched is live and current data.
